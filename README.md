# ISLANDISTAN

The island is actually many smaller islands, that have everything for everyone. You have the lovely beaches where you can roam all day, drink cocktails from our local bars. We also have an island with lovely mountain range where you can hike if you want to do something more than just lying on the beach. 
The wildlife is all that you can want from a tropical island, you can spot apes in the jungle and elephants roaming around basically everywhere except on the beach. But be careful because there are more dangerous creatues on the island aswell.
There are deadly snakes and spiders, but don't worry our hotel staff are trained to take care of you if the accident is close. 

# CASA OLIVE

The hotel of your dreams, we have everything to offer from a local wine made at our own vineyard, skydiving done with our own planes and staff at the hotel. And also the lovely beaches where you can drink drinks and eat food from the best bartenders and chefs in the whole wide world. 
From this trip you will go from here and want more. 
We offer three different hotel rooms, the Standard, the Deluxe and the Superior. All of them with exceptional standards, but differents sizes and bed types. You want too spend more time in the hotel room with an amazing view, then it's 100% worth it to pay more money to get more out of your stay.
